            <p> This is the story of Ahaan, born in a small fishing village called Pokhara, in southern Nepal. 
                <br/><br/>
                His whole life was about one thing: his farm. It was here that he grew wheat and raised chickens. But one day, Ahaan met Mishka, the daughter of a rich fisherman in the village. Soon they fell madly in love with each other, Ahaan discovered a feeling he had never felt before, he was happy and thought of nothing but her. 
                Unfortunately, Mishka's father wasn't agree. His daughter could not marry a simple peasant, as he called him. In spite of his many warnings, Mishka's father made a radical decision to lock up his daughter when he went to sea, so that they would not see each other again. 
                <br/><br/>
                Mishka could hardly see the sunlight anymore, she was depressed. One day, when the old fisherman returned home, he found his daughter lying on the ground, trembling and full of sweat. He called the best doctors in Pokhara, the druids, the witches, but no one could save poor Mishka. Then one of the witches gave him hope: "A tree bark can save her: the Silver Aspen! But it only grows on the top of the highest snow-capped mountains." 
                <br/><br/>
                The news spread throughout the village, but since he did not live on the mountains, his daughter was already doomed. When Ahaan heard the news, he took courage and confronted the old fisherman: "I will climb the Himalayas to find a Silver Aspen bark, I will save your daughter and you will give me her hand. The father, seeing his last hope, nodded to Ahaan, who immediately left for the mountains.

            <p> Having just arrived at the bottom of this imposing mountain, Ahaan realized that he could not find his way alone with a simple map. Still determined, he went to Kathmandu, the nearest city, to hire a sherpa to accompany him on this perilous journey despite his meager savings.   
                <br/><br/> 
                Once they were ready, they started their ascent following the main paths. On their way, they met some regulars of the mountain walking around and sometimes wanting to discuss with the pair. But Ahaan had no time to lose! He had only one goal in mind: to find the Silver Aspen bark and bring it back home. 
                <br/><br/> 
                They climbed again and again until they reached 3000 meters of altitude. They found themselves in front of a magnificent but rustic suspension bridge, which they began the perilous crossing. No sooner said than done, the wind began to blow. The wind blew into the ropes of the bridge, which made Ahaan sway from left to right. The Sherpa was terrified, but then Ahaan thought of his bride and continued to walk steadily. As the hunger and cold began to set in, the bridge was swaying more and more, when suddenly... His foot touched the ground. They had arrived on the other side! 
                <br/><br/> 
                It was time for them to find a shelter and take refuge for the night. Fortunately, they had all the necessary equipment. They prepared a good hot meal and fell asleep quickly, until the next day...

            <p> The next day when he woke up, the Sherpa had disappeared! Leaving behind him some provisions for Ahaan. A multitude of questions ran through his mind, but Ahaan had no time to waste and he set off again. 
                <br/><br/> 
                At noon, he had already exceeded 6,000 meters! So he rested to have a well-deserved meal. But just as he was about to open his bag of provisions, he heard a loud thump in the bushes. The ground shook and a growl echoed through the valley. It was a white Himalayan wolf! Out of nowhere, it pounced on the bag of provisions and ran off with it. Ahaan couldn't do anything, even if it was only a wolf, its fangs were at least the size of his hand. A bite would have been fatal! Ahaan had no choice, even with an empty stomach, he continued his journey. After all, it had already happened to him not to eat during several days...
                <br/><br/> 
                It was getting colder and colder. His muscles began to tense, he was out of breath and still no tree that would look like a tree Aspen on the horizon. He had to keep going. 
                <br/><br/> 
                His face was peeling, his fingers were barely moving and he couldn't feel his feet. Ahaan could hardly breathe, his last bottle was running out. Evil thoughts crossed his mind, and for the first time he began to regret having come. He even thought of giving up, of turning back, but when he looked up, he saw the top of the mountain in the distance, where the high altitude aspens grow. Ahaan gathered his last strength to continue his ascent.

            <p> Ahaan was now at 8,400 meters, but his body gave out. He was on the ground, he did not want to give up. He started to crawl in the snow, Mishka was his only thought, he had to save her. A tree Aspen was only a few feet away, but Ahaan was exhausted. He reached out and stumbled into a frozen lake. Ahaan was gone, his body remained there, frozen by the ice, at the foot of the tree that could have saved his beloved.
            <br/><br/>
            Even today, the body of Ahaan is preserved by the ice. He lies at an altitude of 8,460 meters. His green boots have become a symbol, a landmark for those who climb the Himalayas. We don't know what happened to Mishka, but we can guess. Perhaps they found themselves up there in paradise, in a clearing of a Aspen forest.
